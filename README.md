Project Description: Kenya’s tribal Archives (‘Utamaduni Archives’)

1. What is the problem you are solving?
   
Kenya's rich cultural history—stories, songs, traditions, and knowledge—is primarily held by elders and communities. This knowledge is at risk of being lost forever due to modernization and the passing of older generations. When this history is recorded, it's often done by outsiders (universities, researchers, documentaries) who sometimes control the copyright, meaning the communities themselves can't access or control their own stories.

This project solves: "How can we help Kenyan communities digitally preserve their own history on their own terms, and share it with the world without giving up their ownership?"

NB://	This is in-line with the Bottom-Up economic agenda of the current regime to grant community-led solutions to the tourism industry and to ensure that tourism proceeds trickle down to the rightful owners of the products through copyrights.

2. What tools did you use?
   
•	Python & Streamlit: To build a simple, beautiful, and free website that acts as the digital "library" or museum.

•	JSON Files: Instead of a complex database, we use simple text files to store all the information. This is like a digital notebook that's easy for anyone to read, backup, and understand.

•	Structured Data: We organize information in a smart, consistent way (like always noting the tribe, the type of story, and who told it) so it's useful for researchers and future projects.

3. What insights did you discover? What Solutions do you offer?
   
The solution isn't to take content from communities and put it online. The solution is to create a catalog or a library index that points to where the content lives.

1.	Community Control: Each tribe decides exactly how their content can be used. They can say "This can only be used for education" or "No one can use this without our permission."
   
3.	The "Digital Library Card": The platform doesn't store the actual sacred song or video. It stores the information about it (who owns it, what it's about, how to ask for access) and a link to where the community has chosen to store it (e.g., their own YouTube channel, a university server they trust).
   
5.	Preservation: We save the context—the full story behind a photo, the meaning of a proverb, the name of the elder who shared it. This context is often more valuable than the item itself.
   
Do People even need these solutions?

Communities want to preserve their heritage but often lack the digital tools. The world wants to learn about authentic Kenyan culture but struggles to find reliable, ethical sources. This project bridges that gap.

4. How would a community benefit from your work?

•	Preserves Legacy: Safeguards their cultural identity for future generations within the community.

•	Economic Opportunity: Creates a platform to ethically share their culture. A filmmaker who wants to use a story must now contact the community directly and potentially pay for the rights, keeping the value within the community.

•	Controls the Narrative: Communities tell their own stories, in their own words, instead of letting outsiders interpret them.

•	Global Connection: Provides a legitimate and respectful way for the Kenyan diaspora and global audience to connect with and learn about their heritage.

5. How will you deploy your project?
6. 
a)	I will deploy it for free using Streamlit Community Cloud. The app gets a public web address (e.g., utamaduni-archive.streamlit.app) that anyone in the world can visit, for free, forever.

b)	The Data is Safe: All the stories and information are stored in simple JSON files that can be easily backed up on a USB drive, emailed, or printed out. The community will always have a copy.

In a nutshell: This project is a digital fortress for Kenyan culture, built with Python,JSON and deployed on Streamlit. It gives communities the key to their own fortress, allowing them to preserve their history and decide who gets to learn from it.
