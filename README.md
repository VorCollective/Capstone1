## Utamaduni Archives: Safeguarding Kenya's Tribal Heritage


The Utamaduni Archives is a digital platform that empowers Kenyan communities to preserve, manage, and share their cultural heritageâ€”like stories, songs, and traditionsâ€”on their own terms. Instead of storing the content itself, it acts as a "digital library card" system, cataloging information about each cultural artifact and linking to where the community chooses to host it. Most importantly, it allows communities to set their own rules for who can access their culture and how it can be used.

Who It Is For

Kenyan Communities & Elders: The primary users.
It gives them the tools to digitally safeguard their legacy and control their narrative.

Cultural Rights Advocates & Researchers: Provides a trusted, ethical source for accessing authentic cultural materials with clear permissions.

The Kenyan Diaspora & Global Audience: Offers a legitimate window into authentic Kenyan heritage, ensuring they are connecting with and learning from the source.

Content Creators & Institutions: (e.g., filmmakers, museums, schools) Allows them to ethically source and license cultural content by connecting directly with the rightsholders.
